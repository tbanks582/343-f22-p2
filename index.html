        <li><p>I want to make a project that takes a location and tells you how you're going to die probably based on data from the csv
                I got that im going to use a python script to compile to make proportional likelihood cause of death by state.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>make python script to compress data into maybe top 25 causes</li>
                <li>this actually wont satisfy cuz im just reading data from data.gov rather than using their api but id be crazy to run 
                    the pythons script locally every time after getting updated data</li>
                <li>i do want to us https://docs.lexigram.io/ api</li>
                <li>maybe get facts about classification from https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/ but that sounds lame</li>
