                    my application helps sick people decide what kind of clothes to wear. using colormind.io's color pallette generator which is 
                    fed data from Infermedica's natural language parsing and diagnosis endpoints to get a handful of colors to choose from when
                    deciding what to wear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    besides the trivial implementation of infermedica's diagnosis endpoint which could otherwise be legitimately important,
                    this service is of no real use to anyone, which has informed my design theory and choices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    please don't ask how the data from my diagnostic tool relates the colors i choose to sample from.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    site is deployed on github.
                </li>
                <li>
                    media query puts the color squares into 2x2 + 1 grid instead of 1x5 row to make space on a smaller screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am using 2 endpoints of the Infermedica api along with colormind.io's suggestion-based color pallette generator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the search feature is primary function of the application - searching Infermedica's database of
                    symptoms with 3 statements of illness gives you some limited diagnosis and generates a color pattern.
                </li>
                <li>
                    this project was mostly stupid and didnt generate enough data to warrant filtering results in any meaningful or useful way,
                    unfortunately. I imagine I could easily allow some sort of filtration of data cached by successive calls to the api, but I still 
                    don't know if that would yield anything meaningful.
